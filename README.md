Welcome to the Hello World of Machine Learning Project

Given our hands on nature of our group study. I propose this well known dataset for our play

Your goal for chapter 3:
1. When you finish each chapter, try to mimic its solution using our dataset and show the accuracy.
2. For each of us, please create a folder as your windows username, from there, include your notebook, environment etc.
3. As a group, you are encouraged to use any framework as you like, if we have multiple submission, it will be very interesting to see how different framework differs
